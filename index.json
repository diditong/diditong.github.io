PDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena such as heat, diffusion,fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, etc.\nTraditional methods for solving PDEs include Finite Element Methods (FEM), Finite Difference Methods (FDM) and Finite Volume Methods (FVM). In recent years, researchers start to develop deep neural networks (DNNs), also known as deep learning, for solving PDEs.\nUsing DNNs achieves better flexibility than traditional computational methods. A DNN model only needs to be trained once to repeatedly generate precise solutions for a whole family of PDEs. Besides, it often consumes less computational power.\nMy graduate research focuses on developing DNNs for solving the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the dynamics of viscous fluid.\n","date":1573777341,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573777341,"objectID":"d9f997f10924b859d541c8017dbbcd75","permalink":"https://diditong.github.io/project/fem-and-deep-learning/","publishdate":"2019-11-15T00:22:21Z","relpermalink":"/project/fem-and-deep-learning/","section":"project","summary":"My graduate research project","tags":["Finite Element Method, Deep Learning"],"title":"Deep Learning For Solving PDE's","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Project Purpose  This is the final project for CS 547: Deep Learning offered by University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in Fall 2019.
